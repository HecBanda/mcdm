    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal Programming is an approach used for solving multi-objective optimization problems that balance trade-offs in conflicting objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Goal Programming?**\n",
    "- An approach to derive the best possible 'satisfactory' level of goal attainment\n",
    "- Extends linear programming to handle multiple, often conflicting, goals\n",
    "- Seeks to minimize deviations from predetermined target values (goals)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "1. **Multiple Goals**: Accommodates multiple and often conflicting incommensurable goals (dimensions and units may differ)\n",
    "2. **Priority Structure**: Goals are ranked or weighted according to their importance\n",
    "3. **Satisficing Approach**: Aims for satisfactory solutions rather than optimal solutions\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Treatment**: More important goals are achieved first, at the expense of less important ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Goal Programming:**\n",
    "- When you have multiple objectives that cannot all be optimized simultaneously\n",
    "- When objectives have different units of measurement (e.g., cost vs. time vs. quality)\n",
    "- When decision-makers can specify target levels for each objective\n",
    "- When there's a clear priority hierarchy among objectives"

    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal Programming can be thought of as an extension or generalization of linear programming to handle multiple, normally conflicting objective measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Values**: Each objective measure is given a goal or target value to be achieved\n",
    "- **Deviation Minimization**: Unwanted deviations from this set of target values are minimized in an achievement function\n",
    "  - This can be a vector or a weighted sum depending on the goal programming variant used\n",
    "- **Satisficing Philosophy**: As satisfaction of the target is deemed to satisfy the decision maker, an underlying satisficing philosophy is assumed\n",
    "- **Three Types of Analysis**:\n",
    "  1. Determine the required resources to achieve a desired set of objectives\n",
    "  2. Determine the degree of attainment of the goals with the available resources\n",
    "  3. Provide the best satisfying solution under a varying amount of resources and priorities of the goals"

    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Maker**: The decision maker(s) refer to the person(s), organization(s), or stakeholder(s) to whom the decision problem under consideration belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variable**: A decision variable is defined as a factor over which the decision maker has control. The set of decision variables fully describe the problem and form the decision to be made. The purpose of the goal programming model can be viewed as a search of all the possible combinations of decision variable values (known as decision space) in order to determine the point which best satisfies the decision maker's goals and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criterion**: A criterion is a single measure by which the goodness of any solution to a decision problem can be measured. There are many possible criteria arising from different fields of application but some of the most commonly arising relate at the highest level to:\n",
    "- Cost\n",
    "- Profit\n",
    "- Time\n",
    "- Distance\n",
    "- Performance of a system\n",
    "- Company or organizational strategy\n",
    "- Personal preferences of the decision maker(s)\n",
    "- Safety considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)**: A decision problem which has more than one criterion is therefore referred to as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) or multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) problem. The space formed by the set of criteria is known as criteria space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aspiration Level**: The numerical value specified by the decision maker that reflects his/her desire or satisfactory level with regard to the objective function under consideration. For example, suppose the company wishes to maximize the profit which is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Max \\ z = 2x_1 + 3x_2 \\qquad ...(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Further suppose the management wishes to have at-least 40,000 as profit, then the above stated objective is required to be re-written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2x_1 + 3x_2 \\geq 40,000 \\qquad ...(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, 40,000 is the aspiration level with respect to profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: An objective function along with its aspiration level is called a goal. For example, the relation (1) is an objective function whereas relation (2) is a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal Deviation**: The difference between what we actually achieve and what we desire to achieve. There are two types of goal deviations:\n",
    "- **Positive deviation or overachievement** ($d^+$)\n",
    "- **Negative deviation or underachievement** ($d^-$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, goals can be defined in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive deviation** (when we want to stay at or below the target):\n",
    "$$f(x) \\leq a$$\n",
    "$$f(x) - d^+ = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative deviation** (when we want to stay at or above the target):\n",
    "$$f(x) \\geq a$$\n",
    "$$f(x) + d^- = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both deviations** (when we want to hit the target exactly):\n",
    "$$f(x) = a$$\n",
    "$$f(x) - d^+ + d^- = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**: In general, for goal programming irrespective of the type of the goal we can use both the deviations for each case. However, for the first two cases it is required to minimize just one of the deviation only."

    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Desirable vs. Undesirable Deviations** (depend on the objectives)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max goals (≥)** - the more the better - $d_i^+$ or $p_i$ desirable.\n",
    "- **Min goals (≤)** - the less the better - $d_i^+$ or $n_i$ desirable.\n",
    "- **Exact goals (=)** - exactly equal - both $d_i^+$ (or $p_i$) and $d_i^-$ (or $n_i$) undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In all situations, we first identify the undesirable deviation of the expression in the goal and then attempt to minimize the same.\n",
    "- In GP, the objective is to minimize the (weighted) sum of undesirable deviations (all undesirable $d_i^+$ (or $p_i$) and $d_i^-$ (or $n_i$) → 0).\n",
    "- For each goal, at least one of $d_i^+$ (or $p_i$) and $d_i^-$ (or $n_i$) must be equal to \"0\".\n",
    "- An optimal solution is attained when all the goals are reached as close as possible to their aspiration level, while satisfying a set of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complementarity Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For any goal $i$, the positive and negative deviations cannot both be positive simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_i^+ \\cdot d_i^- = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means at least one deviation must be zero."
