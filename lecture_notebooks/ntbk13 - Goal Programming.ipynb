    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal Programming is an approach used for solving multi-objective optimization problems that balance trade-offs in conflicting objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Goal Programming?**\n",
    "- An approach to derive the best possible 'satisfactory' level of goal attainment\n",
    "- Extends linear programming to handle multiple, often conflicting, goals\n",
    "- Seeks to minimize deviations from predetermined target values (goals)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "1. **Multiple Goals**: Accommodates multiple and often conflicting incommensurable goals (dimensions and units may differ)\n",
    "2. **Priority Structure**: Goals are ranked or weighted according to their importance\n",
    "3. **Satisficing Approach**: Aims for satisfactory solutions rather than optimal solutions\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Treatment**: More important goals are achieved first, at the expense of less important ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Goal Programming:**\n",
    "- When you have multiple objectives that cannot all be optimized simultaneously\n",
    "- When objectives have different units of measurement (e.g., cost vs. time vs. quality)\n",
    "- When decision-makers can specify target levels for each objective\n",
    "- When there's a clear priority hierarchy among objectives"

    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal Programming can be thought of as an extension or generalization of linear programming to handle multiple, normally conflicting objective measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Values**: Each objective measure is given a goal or target value to be achieved\n",
    "- **Deviation Minimization**: Unwanted deviations from this set of target values are minimized in an achievement function\n",
    "  - This can be a vector or a weighted sum depending on the goal programming variant used\n",
    "- **Satisficing Philosophy**: As satisfaction of the target is deemed to satisfy the decision maker, an underlying satisficing philosophy is assumed\n",
    "- **Three Types of Analysis**:\n",
    "  1. Determine the required resources to achieve a desired set of objectives\n",
    "  2. Determine the degree of attainment of the goals with the available resources\n",
    "  3. Provide the best satisfying solution under a varying amount of resources and priorities of the goals"

    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Maker**: The decision maker(s) refer to the person(s), organization(s), or stakeholder(s) to whom the decision problem under consideration belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variable**: A decision variable is defined as a factor over which the decision maker has control. The set of decision variables fully describe the problem and form the decision to be made. The purpose of the goal programming model can be viewed as a search of all the possible combinations of decision variable values (known as decision space) in order to determine the point which best satisfies the decision maker's goals and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criterion**: A criterion is a single measure by which the goodness of any solution to a decision problem can be measured. There are many possible criteria arising from different fields of application but some of the most commonly arising relate at the highest level to:\n",
    "- Cost\n",
    "- Profit\n",
    "- Time\n",
    "- Distance\n",
    "- Performance of a system\n",
    "- Company or organizational strategy\n",
    "- Personal preferences of the decision maker(s)\n",
    "- Safety considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)**: A decision problem which has more than one criterion is therefore referred to as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) or multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) problem. The space formed by the set of criteria is known as criteria space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aspiration Level**: The numerical value specified by the decision maker that reflects his/her desire or satisfactory level with regard to the objective function under consideration. For example, suppose the company wishes to maximize the profit which is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Max \\ z = 2x_1 + 3x_2 \\qquad ...(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Further suppose the management wishes to have at-least 40,000 as profit, then the above stated objective is required to be re-written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2x_1 + 3x_2 \\geq 40,000 \\qquad ...(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, 40,000 is the aspiration level with respect to profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: An objective function along with its aspiration level is called a goal. For example, the relation (1) is an objective function whereas relation (2) is a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal Deviation**: The difference between what we actually achieve and what we desire to achieve. There are two types of goal deviations:\n",
    "- **Positive deviation or overachievement** ($d^+$)\n",
    "- **Negative deviation or underachievement** ($d^-$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, goals can be defined in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive deviation** (when we want to stay at or below the target):\n",
    "$$f(x) \\leq a$$\n",
    "$$f(x) - d^+ = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative deviation** (when we want to stay at or above the target):\n",
    "$$f(x) \\geq a$$\n",
    "$$f(x) + d^- = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both deviations** (when we want to hit the target exactly):\n",
    "$$f(x) = a$$\n",
    "$$f(x) - d^+ + d^- = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**: In general, for goal programming irrespective of the type of the goal we can use both the deviations for each case. However, for the first two cases it is required to minimize just one of the deviation only."

    "- In all situations, we first identify the undesirable deviation of the expression in the goal and then attempt to minimize the same.\n",

    "U.S. Oil, which has a return of $3 on a $25 share price, provides an annual rate of return of 12%, whereas Hub Properties provides an annual rate of return of 10%. The risk index per share, 0.50 for U.S. Oil and 0.25 for Hub Properties, is a rating assigned to measure the relative risk of the two investments. Higher risk index values imply greater risk; hence, U.S. Oil is judged to be the riskier investment. By specifying a maximum portfolio risk index, the client will avoid placing too much of the portfolio in high-risk investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how to use the risk index per share to measure the total portfolio risk, suppose that the client chooses a portfolio that invests all $80,000 in U.S. Oil, the higher risk but higher return investment. The client could purchase $80,000/$25 = 3200 shares of U.S. Oil, and the portfolio would have a risk index of 3200(0.50) = 1600. Conversely, if the client purchases no shares of either stock, the portfolio will have no risk, but also no return. Thus, the portfolio risk index would vary from 0 (least risk) to 1600 (most risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "The client would like to avoid a high risk portfolio; thus, investing all funds in U.S. Oil would not be desirable. However, the client agreed that an acceptable level of risk would correspond to portfolios with a maximum total risk index of 700 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another goal of the client is to obtain an annual return of at least $9,000. This goal can be achieved with a portfolio consisting of 2000 shares of U.S. Oil [at a cost of 2000($25) = $50,000] and 600 shares of Hub Properties [at a cost of 600($50) = $30,000]; the annual return in this case would be 2000($3) + 600($5) = $9,000. Note, however, that the portfolio risk index for this investment strategy would be 2000(0.50) + 600(0.25) = 1150; thus, this portfolio achieves the annual return goal but does not satisfy the portfolio risk index goal."

    "# Problem: Textile Company Production\n",
    "\n",
    "A textile company produces two types of materials A and B. Material A is produced according to direct orders from furniture manufacturers. The material B is distributed to retail fabric stores. The average production rates for material A and B are identical at 1000 metres/hour. By running two shifts the operational capacity of the plant is 80 hours per week. The marketing department reports that the maximum estimated sales for the following week is 70000 metres of material A and 45000 metres of material B. According to the accounting department the profit from a metre of material A is Php 2.50 and from a metre of material B is Php 1.50. The management of the company decides that a stable employment level is the primary goal for the firm. Therefore, whenever there is demand exceeding normal production capacity, management simply expands production capacity by providing overtime. However, management feels that overtime operation of the plant of more than 10 hours per week should be avoided because of the accelerating costs.\n",

    "## Why the Weights 5 and 3 in Priority P3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: **not all shortfalls hurt equally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Material A earns Php 2.50 per metre, while Material B earns only Php 1.50 per metre. So if you miss selling 1 hour's worth of production (1000 metres):\n",
    "- Missing Material A costs you: 1000 × Php 2.50 = **Php 2,500** in lost profit\n",
    "- Missing Material B costs you: 1000 × Php 1.50 = **Php 1,500** in lost profit\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of these losses is 2.50 : 1.50, which simplifies to **5 : 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The intuition:** If you can only produce a limited amount and must choose which sales goal to miss, you'd rather fall short on the less profitable product (Material B). The weights tell the optimizer: \"Care about Material A shortfalls almost twice as much as Material B shortfalls.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose you're 1 hour short on Material A ($d_2^- = 1$) vs. 1 hour short on Material B ($d_3^- = 1$):\n",
    "- Penalty for missing A: $5 \\times 1 = 5$\n",
    "- Penalty for missing B: $3 \\times 1 = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer will prioritize reducing the Material A shortfall because it \"costs\" more in the objective function, which aligns with the real-world consequence of losing more profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short:** The weights make the model reflect business priorities—missing high-profit products should hurt more than missing low-profit ones."
