    "## 2. What is TOPSIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "**TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** is a multi-criteria decision analysis method that ranks alternatives based on their geometric distance to the ideal solution. The fundamental principle is that the best alternative should be closest to the positive ideal solution (PIS) and farthest from the negative ideal solution (NIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "![TOPSIS Concept](..\\figures\\TOPSIS.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept: The Ideal Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have:\n",
    "1. **Shortest geometric distance** from the Positive Ideal Solution (PIS)\n",
    "2. **Longest geometric distance** from the Negative Ideal Solution (NIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positive Ideal Solution (PIS or A⁺)\n",
    "- Composed of the **best values** of each criterion\n",
    "- For benefit criteria: maximum values\n",
    "- For cost criteria: minimum values\n",
    "- Represents the \"perfect\" alternative (usually hypothetical)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Negative Ideal Solution (NIS or A⁻)\n",
    "- Composed of the **worst values** of each criterion  \n",
    "- For benefit criteria: minimum values\n",
    "- For cost criteria: maximum values\n",
    "- Represents the \"worst possible\" alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The TOPSIS method calculates a **closeness coefficient (CC)** for each alternative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CC_i = \\frac{S_i^-}{S_i^+ + S_i^-}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $S_i^+$ = Distance from alternative $i$ to positive ideal solution\n",
    "- $S_i^-$ = Distance from alternative $i$ to negative ideal solution\n",
    "- $CC_i$ ranges from 0 to 1 (higher values indicate better alternatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions\n",
    "1. **Monotonicity**: More of a benefit criterion is better, less of a cost criterion is better\n",
    "2. **Compensation**: Trade-offs between criteria are allowed\n",
    "3. **Independence**: Criteria are independent (no interactions)\n",
    "4. **Commensurability**: After normalization, all criteria can be compared\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use TOPSIS\n",
    "**Suitable for:**\n",
    "- Problems with quantitative criteria\n",
    "- When criteria weights are known or can be determined\n",
    "- When complete ranking of alternatives is needed\n",
    "- Problems requiring compensation between criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not suitable for:**\n",
    "- Purely qualitative problems\n",
    "- When criteria have complex interdependencies\n",
    "- When no compensation is allowed between criteria\n",
    "- Very small datasets (less than 3 alternatives)"

    "\n",
    "$$r_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij}^2}}$$\n",
