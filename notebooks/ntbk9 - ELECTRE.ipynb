    "# ELECTRE Method in Multi-Criteria Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**ELECTRE** (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité - Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) is a family of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods developed by Bernard Roy in the 1960s. ELECTRE methods are particularly useful for decision problems involving conflicting criteria and help decision-makers handle uncertainty and incomparability between alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ELECTRE family includes several variants:\n",
    "- **ELECTRE I**: For selection problems (choosing the best alternative)\n",
    "- **ELECTRE II**: For ranking problems  \n",
    "- **ELECTRE III**: For ranking with pseudo-criteria\n",
    "- **ELECTRE IV**: For ranking without weights\n",
    "- **ELECTRE TRI**: For sorting problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on **ELECTRE I**, which is the foundation for understanding other ELECTRE methods."

    "## Key Concepts and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes ELECTRE Unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outranking Relations**: Unlike other MCDA methods that assign scores, ELECTRE builds outranking relations between alternatives (A outranks B if A is at least as good as B).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Incomparability**: ELECTRE explicitly recognizes that some alternatives may be incomparable, which is more realistic than forcing a complete ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Threshold-based Approach**: Uses concordance and discordance thresholds to handle uncertainty and preference modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Compensation**: ELECTRE is a non-compensatory method - a very poor performance on one criterion cannot be completely offset by excellent performance on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concordance**: Measures the strength of evidence supporting the hypothesis that alternative A outranks alternative B\n",
    "- **Discordance**: Measures the strength of evidence against the hypothesis that A outranks B\n",
    "- **Veto Threshold**: A criterion can \"veto\" an outranking relation if the difference in performance is too large"

    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define our decision problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A** = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ}: Set of m alternatives\n",
    "- **C** = {c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ}: Set of n criteria  \n",
    "- **W** = {w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ}: Set of criteria weights where Σwⱼ = 1\n",
    "- **gⱼ(aᵢ)**: Performance of alternative aᵢ on criterion cⱼ\n",
    "- **X**: Decision matrix where xᵢⱼ = gⱼ(aᵢ)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preference Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "For each criterion cⱼ, we can define:\n",
    "- **Indifference threshold (qⱼ)**: Below this difference, alternatives are considered indifferent\n",
    "- **Preference threshold (pⱼ)**: Above this difference, strict preference is established  \n",
    "- **Veto threshold (vⱼ)**: Above this difference, one alternative completely dominates\n",

    "## ELECTRE I Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The ELECTRE I method follows these main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Normalize the Decision Matrix\n",
    "Convert all criteria to a comparable scale (usually 0-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate Weighted Normalized Matrix  \n",
    "Apply criteria weights to the normalized values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Calculate Concordance Index\n",
    "For each pair of alternatives (aᵢ, aₖ):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concordance Index C(i,k)**:\n",
    "$$C(i,k) = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in J^+} w_j}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where J⁺ is the set of criteria for which alternative aᵢ is at least as good as aₖ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Calculate Discordance Index\n",
    "For each pair of alternatives (aᵢ, aₖ):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discordance Index D(i,k)**:\n",
    "$$D(i,k) = \\frac{\\max_{j \\in J^-} |g_j(a_i) - g_j(a_k)|}{\\max_{j=1,...,n} |g_j(a_i) - g_j(a_k)|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where J⁻ is the set of criteria for which alternative aᵢ is worse than aₖ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Determine Outranking Relations\n",
    "Alternative aᵢ outranks aₖ if:\n",
    "- C(i,k) ≥ concordance threshold (usually ≥ 0.5)\n",
    "- D(i,k) ≤ discordance threshold (usually ≤ 0.5)"

    "## Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Realistic Decision Modeling**: Acknowledges that some alternatives may be incomparable\n",
    "2. **No Compensation Effects**: Poor performance on one criterion cannot be completely offset\n",
    "3. **Handles Uncertainty**: Uses thresholds to model decision-maker uncertainty\n",
    "4. **Flexible Framework**: Different variants for different types of problems\n",
    "5. **Transparent Process**: Clear distinction between concordance and discordance\n",
    "6. **Robust Results**: Less sensitive to small changes in input data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Parameter Setting**: Requires careful selection of concordance/discordance thresholds\n",
    "2. **No Clear Ranking**: May result in multiple non-dominated alternatives\n",
    "3. **Computational Complexity**: Increases significantly with number of alternatives\n",
    "4. **Subjective Thresholds**: Threshold values can significantly affect results\n",
    "5. **Limited Sensitivity Analysis**: Difficult to assess impact of parameter changes\n",
    "6. **Learning Curve**: More complex to understand than simple scoring methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ELECTRE\n",
    "\n",
    "- When compensation between criteria is not acceptable\n",
    "- When dealing with conflicting criteria\n",
    "- When uncertainty in preferences exists\n",
    "- When incomparability between alternatives is realistic\n",
    "- For selection problems rather than detailed ranking"

    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways from Our ELECTRE Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method Understanding**: ELECTRE I uses outranking relations rather than scoring, making it suitable for decisions where compensation between criteria is not acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Our Results**: In the smartphone selection example, the analysis identified the best alternatives based on the specified criteria and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Threshold Sensitivity**: The choice of concordance and discordance thresholds significantly affects the final ranking. This highlights the importance of careful parameter selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Non-Compensatory Nature**: Unlike methods like SAW or TOPSIS, ELECTRE I does not allow poor performance on one criterion to be completely offset by excellence in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ELECTRE I\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best suited for:**\n",
    "- Selection problems (choosing the best from a set)\n",
    "- Situations where trade-offs between criteria are limited\n",
    "- Problems with qualitative and quantitative criteria mixed\n",
    "- When incomparability between alternatives is acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not ideal for:**\n",
    "- Problems requiring complete ranking of all alternatives\n",
    "- Situations where computational simplicity is paramount\n",
    "- When stakeholders prefer compensatory decision models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To further explore ELECTRE methods, consider:\n",
    "- **ELECTRE II/III**: For ranking problems with pseudo-criteria\n",
    "- **ELECTRE TRI**: For sorting problems (assigning alternatives to predefined categories)\n",
    "- **Parameter tuning**: Systematic approaches to set thresholds\n",
    "- **Group decision making**: Extensions for multiple decision makers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Quality**: Ensure accurate and consistent data collection\n",
    "2. **Weight Elicitation**: Use structured methods like AHP for weight determination\n",
    "3. **Threshold Setting**: Consider the decision context and consult domain experts\n",
    "4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Always test robustness of results to parameter changes\n",
    "5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Include decision makers in the process validation"
